            <h3>9.<u> DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION:-</u></h3>    
            <p><b>Generally:</b><br/>
               In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Company in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Company agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Exceptions:</b><br/>
               we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to <br/>(i) bring an individual action in small claims court,<br/> (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available,<br/> (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.
            </p>
            <p><b>Modifications:</b><br/>
                In the event that Company makes any future change to this arbitration provision, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Company’s address for Notice, in which case your account with Company shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.
